All of the back-end systems run inside of Docker containers. To build locally and see how things work the only requirement is that you install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). During the installation phase you will notice errors if you haven't set your Docker configuration to use 4 GB of memory. Changing this is simple within the Docker configuration dialog. Just set the memory higher and restart Docker.
